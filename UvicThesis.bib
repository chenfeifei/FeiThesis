	abstract = {In this tutorial I analyze the polarization-dependent properties of different optical contrasts widely used today in imaging, applied to biology and biomedical diagnostics. I derive the essential properties of the polarization dependence of optical processes such as two-photon fluorescence, nonlinear coherent effects in the nonresonant as well as vibrational-resonant regimes, and analyze how they can be exploited to provide information on the molecular orientational organization in a biological sample. Two examples will be detailed: the first one the measurement of lipid order in artificial and cell membranes by using fluorescent labeling, and the second one structural imaging of collagen in tissues by using second-harmonic generation.}
