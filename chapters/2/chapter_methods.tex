\section{Description}
Before analyzing the LP model and applying it to the real molecules' vibrational spectra, there are a few factors to address. First of all, creating each amino acid's IR, Raman and SFG spectra is an essential step. For this part of research has been done thoroughly by Hung \cite{KuoKaiHung:Thesis:2015}. In this chapter, I will introduce the content that is related to my study. \\

\section{Generating Model Spectra}
To generate these amino acids' vibrational spectra, a molecule's vibration modes need to be modelled in the molecular frame, then transferred to the laboratory frame to work with the systems where interfaces exist. Chapter 2 in Hung's thesis \cite{KuoKaiHung:Thesis:2015} describes how to perform electronic structure calculations using GAMESS \cite{GAMESS} to obtain the derivatives of every dipole moment and polarizability. Then he introduced how to use Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) to transfer these two derivatives from the molecular coordinate system to the laboratory one. After that, Euler angles could be extracted from DCM. Euler angles are used to describe a molecule's orientation at interfaces. They are labelled by $\theta$, $\phi$ and $\psi$ as shown in Figure \ref{fig:2.1}. They are referred as $tilt$, $azimuthal$ and $twist$ angles, respectively. Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ be lab frame Cartesian coordinates, and $a$, $b$ and $c$ be the molecular frame coordinates. $Tilt$ angle $\theta$ is the angle between $z$ and $c$. $Azimuthal$ angle $\varphi$ is the rotation about $z$. $Twist$ angle $\psi$ is a twist about $c$ \cite{hore0033-rotations}. After three steps of successive rotations of Euler angles, molecule properties can be transferred from the molecular frame to the lab frame. \\

In order to achieve the above steps, Hung first did a Hessian calculation using GAMESS. Secondly, 7 snapshots of a molecule vibrating in different modes were taken. Thirdly, he did a force field calculation to obtain the derivatives of dipole moment and polarizability for each 7 snapshot moment. Then the derivatives of dipole moment and polarizability are obtained by the interpolation of these 7 snapshot moment. Because the two obtained derivatives are in the molecular frame, Hung used DCM to convert these two derivatives into the lab frame. Then abstracted Euler angles from DCM. After this transformation, he restored the derivatives information into some molecular property files for any further usage. \\

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\end{figure}

In my study, those molecular property files are used to generate the amino acids' spectroscopy information directly. Each molecular property file contains the derivatives of dipole moment and polarizabilities of each vibrational mode. Depends on the number $N$ of atoms in a molecule, there are $3N-6$ vibrational modes. Furthermore, Equation \ref{eq:2.2} to \ref{eq:2.4} are used to generate the amino acids' IR, Raman and SFG spectra. \\

All the test cases in my study are limited to only consider the $tilt$ angle distribution of Euler angles, and assume isotropy on $twist$ and $azimuthal$ angular distributions. Therefore, $twist$ and $azimuthal$ angles are integrated to create a uniform distribution. For angle $\varphi$, it requires the surfaces to be not striped. There can be no anisotropy in the plane of the surface. Because of this, we can limit the candidate number by integrating angle $\varphi$. On the other hand, for angle $\psi$, a uniform distribution implies that the molecule has cylindrical symmetry in its preference of surface. This means that the molecule can be tilted, but has no `$twist$' preference. With the integration of these two Euler angles, the number of candidates for one molecule will be greatly reduced. Therefore, a candidate in my study is a specific molecule with specific $\theta$ value. However, the number of the candidates is still large when only considering $\theta$ angle. For example, when every $10^{{\circ}}$ a candidate is obtained, there are $18$ candidates of one molecule. In the mixture of six molecules, the number of possible combinations of all these molecules' candidates is $18^{6} = 34012224$ . \\

When molecules lay on an interface, the orientation of each molecule varies. To simulate the vibrational spectra, a reasonable orientation distribution for the molecules needed to be studied. The orientation distribution requires either do a molecular dynamic simulation to study the distribution of molecule orientations at the interface, or come up with a analytic orientation distribution function. In my study, the second method is selected. Moreover, $\delta$-distribution function shown in Equation \ref{eq:2.1} is used to represent the molecule orientation distribution that models the spectrum signals. This means that all the molecules are tilted at one same angle at the interface. This assumption is applied across the whole study. \\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.1}
f_{(\theta)} = \delta(\theta - \theta_{o})
\end{equation} 

The absorption of a (IR) spectrum is proportional to the square of the lab-frame dipole moment derivative. For example, the $x$-polarized absorption spectrum is given by Equation \ref{eq:2.2}: \\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.2}
A_x(\omega_{\rm IR}) = \sum_{q} \frac{1}{2 m_{q} \omega_{\rm q}} \Bigg \langle \Bigg\lbrack \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial Q} \Bigg\rbrack_{q} ^2 \Bigg\rangle \frac{\Gamma_q^2}{(\omega_{\rm IR}-\omega_{\rm q})^2 + \Gamma_q^2}
\end{equation} 
where $A_x$ represents $x$-polarized intensity. The same equation applies to $A_y$ and $A_z$. $\omega_{\rm IR}$ is the frequency of the probe radiation, $\mu$ is the dipole moment, $m_q$ is the reduced mass, $w_q$ is resonance frequency. $\Gamma_q$ is the homogeneous line width, is set to $6$ in all the test cases. $Q_q$ is the normal mode coordinate of the $q$th vibrational mode. All values of $\omega_{\rm IR}$, $\mu$, $m_q$, $Q$ are obtained from the electronic structure calculations. Furthermore, because $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles are integrated, the $x$-polarized spectrum is identical with the $y$-polarized one. Therefore, there are only two unique polarized IR spectra. For simplicity, IR spectra are referred as $x$ and $z$ in future experiments. \\

The intensity of Raman scattering is proportional to the square of laboratory-frame transition polarizability. For example, Raman spectroscopy with an $x$-polarized excitation source collects the $x$-polarized component of the scattered radiation, which can be approximated from Equation \ref{eq:2.3}. \\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.3}
I_{xx}(\Delta \omega) = \sum_{q} \frac{1}{2 m_{q} \omega_{\rm q}} \Bigg \langle \Bigg\lbrack \frac{\partial \alpha_{xx}^{(1)}}{\partial Q} \Bigg\rbrack_{q} ^2 \Bigg\rangle \frac{\Gamma_q^2}{(\Delta \omega-\omega_{\rm q})^2 + \Gamma_q^2}
\end{equation} 
where $\Delta w$ is the Stokes Raman shift. $\alpha_{xx}^{(1)}$ is one component of the $9$-element polarizability tensor. $m_q$, $w_q$, $\Gamma_q$, and $Q_q$ are the same as defined above for IR spectra. All the values of $\omega_{\rm IR}$, $\mu$, $m_q$, $Q$ are obtained from the electronic structure calculations. Similar to IR spectroscopy, because of the integration of $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles, only 4 unique spectra are obtained from the following polarization: $xx$, $xy$, $xz$ and $zz$. For simplicity, Raman spectra are referred as $xx$, $xy$, $xz$ and $zz$ in future experiments. \\

The intensity of SFG spectroscopy is proportional to the squared magnitude of the second-order susceptibility, $\left|\chi^{(2)}\right|^{2}$. $\chi^{(2)}$ is derived from the second-order polarizability, $\alpha^{2}$. Equation \ref{eq:2.4} shows the response intensity of $I_{xxx}$. \\
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.4}
I_{xxz}(\omega_{\rm IR}) = \sum_{q} \frac{1}{2 m_{q} \omega_{\rm q}} \Bigg \langle \Bigg\lbrack \frac{\partial \alpha_{xx}^{(1)}}{\partial Q} \Bigg\rbrack_{q} \Bigg\lbrack \frac{\partial u_{x}}{\partial Q} \Bigg\rbrack_{q} \Bigg\rangle \frac{1}{\omega_{\rm q}-\omega_{\rm IR}-i\Gamma_q}
\end{equation} 
where $I_{xxx}$ is the second-order susceptibility tensor. It is probed by an $x$-polarized visible incoming beam at frequency $\omega_{\rm vis}$ and a $x$-polarized infrared beam incoming with frequency $\omega_{\rm IR}$. Both incoming beams are incident to the sample. Then the $x$-component of SFG at frequency $\omega_{SFG}=\omega_{\rm vis}+\omega_{\rm IR}$ is selected for detection. As $i=\sqrt{-1}$ is in the denominator, $X^{(2)}$ is a complex value \cite{KuoKaiHung:Thesis:2015}. The SFG response is the imaginary component of the second-order susceptibility. Same as IR and Raman spectroscopy, all the values of $\omega_{\rm IR}$, $\mu$, $m_q$, $Q$ are obtained from the molecular property files. Because of the integration of $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles, only 3 unique non-zero spectra are obtained from the following polarizations: $yyz$, $yzy$ and $zzz$. For simplicity, SFG spectra are referred as $yyz$, $yzy$ and $zzz$ in future experiments.  (TODO: double check the accuracy of the content with Dennis). \\

With these equations and the molecular property files, IR, Raman and SFG spectra can be generated for a candidate. A candidate in my study is a specific amino acid with specific $\theta$ value. Taking Methionine as an example, Figure \ref{fig:2.2} displays $x$-polarized IR spectra of the following candidates: Methionine with $\theta$ of $0^{\circ}$, $20^{\circ}$, $40^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$. Their spectra are prefixed with $candidate\_$ in the labels. $ir\_x\_$ indicates the spectroscopy technique, ``number" indicates the $\theta$ angle's value. The spectra labelled as $target\_ir\_x$, is generated by combining $10\%$ of $candidate\_ir\_x\_0$, $50\%$ $candidate\_ir\_x\_20$ and $40\%$ $candidate\_ir\_x\_40$. \\

Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:2.3}, \ref{fig:2.4} and \ref{fig:2.5} depict the spectra of the same candidates and targets for $z$-polarized IR, $xx$-polarized Raman and $yyz$-polarized SFG spectrum respectively. In Figure \ref{fig:2.2}, the biggest differences among the candidates exist at each vibrational mode. The valid range for wavenumber is from 1000 to 2000. Each polarization of IR, Raman or SFG, there are 200 data points can be extracted in the interval of 5 wavenumber. With these data points, the corresponding LP model is constructed as described in Chapter \ref{ch:3}.\\

\section{Conclusion}
Chapter \ref{ch:2} explains what are the current approaches to extract molecular structure at interfaces, and how to produce IR, Raman and SFG spectra theoretically. In Chapter \ref{ch:3}, the properties of the LP model are studied. It is conducted by using a simplified molecular model to gain an insight of the behaviours our LP approach. The motivation of creating a simplified molecular model is to create a molecule as simple as possible, so that only the properties of the LP model is focused. With the further information gained in Chapter \ref{ch:3}, further experiences will be conducted to real molecules in Chapter \ref{ch:4}, \ref{ch:5} and \ref{ch:6}.
