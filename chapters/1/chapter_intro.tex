\section{Background and Motivation}
An interface is what forms a common boundary between two phases of matter. The phases of matter can be of any forms, i.e, solid, liquid, and gas. The behavior of a surface greatly affects the properties of a material, such as oxidation, corrosion, chemical activity, deformation and fracture, surface energy and tension, adhesion, bonding, friction, lubrication, wear and contamination. Therefore, surface characterization identification remains an active area of research in the physics, chemistry, and biotechnology communities as well as in modern electronic technology. It also plays a crucial role in surface science. Among various surface properties, molecular orientation is a key factor of all, because molecular orientation greatly affects molecules' surface properties in aspects such as: adhesion, lubrication, catalysis, bio-membrane functions and so on. \cite{PhysRevB.59.12632}\\

Many experimental techniques have been applied in the study of molecular orientation at interfaces. Among them the optical methods are more preferable. Such methods include infrared (IR) absorption, Raman scattering and visible-infrared sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopies. All these vibrational spectra carry quantitative structural information of molecules at interfaces. Although each of them has its own strengths and shortcomings, they all share the following advantages when compared with other non-optical methods. First of all, they all can be applied to any interfaces accessible by light. Second, they are non-destructive. Third, they are highly sensitive to good spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions \cite{Brasselet:11},\cite{PhysRevB.59.12632}. An important advantage of SFG techniques is that it can discriminate against bulk contributions. This means that its result will not take the effect from the bulk. In order to extract the quantitative structural information that molecules carry at interfaces, different spectroscopy techniques and analyse are required. Combining different spectroscopy techniques is a very effective way to achieve the goal of molecular coordination study at interfaces. However, finding the most effective ways to combine these techniques may not be clear most of time.\\

In order to analyze these vibrational spectra, various factors need to be considered. For example, a molecule's vibrational mode in the molecular frame, the orientation average of the molecules adsorbed onto the interface based on the mathematical distribution function and projecting the vibrational mode properties from molecular frame to laboratory frame. The main focus of our study is to combining Linear Programming (LP) with different spectral information to obtain molecular coordination distribution at interfaces. In the following study, we will explore how LP can facilitate extracting quantitative structural information of molecules at interfaces.\\

Our approach is to first study our LP model's properties by applying it to a toy model of a small molecule. After that, the LP model is applied to the real molecules to further explore the possibilities of our LP model. The real molecules that we are focusing are six amino acids: methionine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, threonine and valine.\\

Before introducing the LP model and the molecule coordination studies, the basic theory of  the IR, Raman and SFG spectra is introduced.\\

\section{Experimental Probes: IR, Raman, SFG}
Vibrational spectra (IR, Raman and SFG) are produced by the changes of a molecule's dipole moment and polarizability. The dipole moment and polarizability are changing as the molecule's conformation is changing. \\

IR is the absorption of the absorption-transmission-reflection mode (resonant). The physical principle is the variation of the static dipole moment $\mu$ (the first rank tensor) along the normal coordinates $Q$: $\sfrac{\partial\mu}{\partial Q}$. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1.1}
I_{IR} \approx \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2m_{Q}w_{Q}}} \frac{\partial\mu}{\partial Q} \right|^{2}
\end{equation}
where $m_{Q}$ is the reduced mass of the normal mode, and $w_{Q}$ is the resonance frequency. The dipole moment $\mu$ is a vector of $x$, $y$ and $z$. The dipole moment derivatives can be expressed as Equation \ref{eq:1.2}. The IR spectra can be obtained from 3 polarizations: $x$, $y$, $z$. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1.2}
\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial Q} = \begin{bmatrix}
									\sfrac{\partial\mu_{x}}{\partial Q} \\
									\sfrac{\partial\mu_{y}}{\partial Q} \\
									\sfrac{\partial\mu_{z}}{\partial Q}
								  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Raman is scattered from a molecule sample. Unlike IR, Raman spectra relate to the variation of the molecular polarizability $\alpha$ (the second rank tensor) along the normal coordinates $Q$: $\sfrac{\partial\alpha}{\partial Q}$. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1.3}
I_{Raman} \approx \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2m_{Q}w_{Q}}} \frac{\partial\alpha^{(1)}}{\partial Q} \right|^{2}
\end{equation}
where $m_{Q}$ and $w_{Q}$ are the same as defined in Equation \ref{eq:1.1}. The polarizability is coupled with $(x, y, z)$ components of the driving field and $x, y, z$ components of the induced polarization. Therefore, there are 9 elements in the polarizability, which can be expressed as Equation \ref{eq:1.4}. It results in 9 polarizations of Raman spectra: $xx$, $yy$, $zz$, $xy$, $xz$, $yx$, $yz$, $zy$ and $zx$. \\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1.4}
\frac{\partial\alpha^{(1)}}{\partial Q} = \begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial\alpha_{xx}^{(1)}}{\partial Q} & \dfrac{\partial\alpha_{xy}^{(1)}}{\partial Q} & \dfrac{\partial\alpha_{xz}^{(1)}}{\partial Q} \\
\dfrac{\partial\mu_{yx}}{\partial Q} & \dfrac{\partial\alpha_{yy}^{(1)}}{\partial Q} & \dfrac{\partial\alpha_{yz}^{(1)}}{\partial Q}\\
\dfrac{\partial\mu_{zx}}{\partial Q} & \dfrac{\partial\alpha_{zy}^{(1)}}{\partial Q} & \dfrac{\partial\alpha_{zz}^{(1)}}{\partial Q}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

SFG stands for sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy. SFG is a surface-specific technique. It is a non-linear optical process. It is sensitive to the molecular orientation in odd orders. Comparing to linear optical spectroscopy, the biggest advantage of SFG is that it is surface specific. The spectroscopy signal only comes from the surface, not the bulk. SFG is the variation of the outer product of dipole moment and polarizability, $\chi^{(2)}$ (the third rank tensor): $\sfrac{\partial\mu}{\partial Q} \otimes \sfrac{\partial\alpha}{\partial Q} $. Therefore, there are 27 elements for SFG spectra, which result in 27 polarizations of SFG spectra. \\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1.5}
I_{SFG} \approx \left| \frac{1}{2m_{Q}w_{Q}} \left( \frac{\partial\alpha^{(1)}}{\partial Q} \otimes \frac{\partial\mu}{\partial Q} \right) \right|^{2}
\end{equation}

\section{Linear programming}
LP problems are an optimization ones of a specific form. The standard form of LP is a minimization problem that has an objective function and a number of constraints as shown in Equation \ref{eq:1.6} \cite{UULP}:

\begin{eqnarray}  \label{eq:1.6}
 \text{minimize} & c_{1}x_{1} + c_{2}x_{2} + ... + c_{n} x_{n}  \nonumber \\
 \text{subject to} & a_{11} x_{1} + a_{12} x_{2}+ ... + a_{1n} x_{n} = & b_{1} \nonumber \\
& a_{21} x_{1} + a_{22} x_{2} + ... + a_{2n} x_{n} = & b_{2} \nonumber \\
&\cdot                                    &\cdot \nonumber \\
&\cdot                                    &\cdot \nonumber \\
&\cdot                                    &\cdot \nonumber \\
& a_{m1} x_{1} + a_{m2} x_{2} + ... + a_{mn} x_{n} = & b_{m} \nonumber \\
& x_{1} \geq 0, x_{2} \geq 0, ... ,x_{n} \geq 0, 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $x_{i}$ are the decision variables, $a_{ij}$ is a matrix of know coefficients, $b_{i}$ and $c_{i}$ are vectors of known coefficients. The expression to be minimized is called objective function. The equalities and the inequalities are the constraints that all the decision variables need to subject to. These constraints specify a convex polytope that the objective function need to optimize over. \\ 

The diet problem is a popular example to illustrate the concept of LP. It is described as follows: a restaurant would like to achieve the minimal nutrition requirements with the lowest price over some the food selections as shown in Table \ref{tab:1.1}. For each meal, the minimum requirements for vitamin A, vitamin C and dietary fiber are $0.5~mg$, $15~mg$ and $4~g$. The restaurant has three food options: raw carrot, raw white cabbage and pickled cucumber. The table also displays the nutrition content and the price of each ingredient. With all the information, we want to know how much carrot, cabbage and cucumber is needed in each meal, so that the minimal nutrition requirements can be met with the lowest price. In summary, the goal is to minimize the price, and the constraints are the nutrition requirements. Therefore, the following LP model is come up as shown in Equations \ref{eq:1.7} ~ \ref{eq:1.13}.

\begin{table} 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l  l  l | l |}
\hline
Food & Carrot & Cabbage & Cucumber & Required per dish \\ \hline
Vitamin A [mg/kg] & 35 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5mg \\ 
Vitamin C [mg/kg] & 60 & 300 & 10 & 15mg \\ 
Dietary Fiber [g/kg] & 30 & 20 & 10 & 4g \\ \hline
price[$\$$/kg] & 0.75 & 0.5 & 0.15 & - \\ \hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
\caption{Sample input of the diet problem}
\label{tab:1.1}
\end{table}	

\begin{eqnarray} 
\text{minimize} & 0.75x_{1} + 0.5x_{2} +  0.15x_{3}  \label{eq:1.7} \\
\text{subject to} & 35x_{1} + 0.5x_{2} + 0.5x_{3} \geq 0.5 \label{eq:1.8} \\
& 60x_{1} + 300x_{2} + 10x_{3} \geq 15 \label{eq:1.9} \\
& 30x_{1} + 20x_{2} + 10x_{3} \geq 4 \label{eq:1.10} \\
& x_{1} \geq 0  \label{eq:1.11} \\
& x_{2} \geq 0  \label{eq:1.12} \\
& x_{3} \geq 0  \label{eq:1.13}
\end{eqnarray} 
In this LP model, $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$ and $x_{3}$ are the decision variables. Each decision variable presents the amount of each ingredient. Equation \ref{eq:1.7} is the objective function to minimize. Equation \ref{eq:1.8} to Equation \ref{eq:1.10} describe the nutrition requirements. Equation \ref{eq:1.11} to Equation \ref{eq:1.13} ensure the amount of each ingredient to be greater than 0. With the existing LP solvers that implemented Simplex Method, the optimal solution can be obtained within a second. \\

For a LP problem, there are only three kinds of solutions: feasible and bounded solutions, feasible and unbounded solutions, and infeasible solutions. If the solution space is feasible and bounded, then there is one optimum solution. If it is feasible but unbounded, then there is a solution space with an infinite number of optimal solutions \cite{LP}. \\

A general LP problem can be a minimization or maximization problem. Its constraints can be equalities or inequalities. For each non-standard LP problem, there are ways to convert it into its standard form. Furthermore, for a LP problem that contains $n$ decision variables, its solution would be in a $n$-dimensional space called $R^{n}$. Each constraint is a hyperplane. It divides the $R^{n}$ space into two half-spaces. Therefore, all the constraints together cut this $R^{n}$ space into a convex polyhedron when there are feasible solutions. This makes LP a convex problem. The benefit of a convex problem is that the local optimal solution is the global optimum. LP solvers return the optimal solution. If a LP problem has a unique optimal solution, this solution is a vertex of the convex polyhedron. In another word, LP is a convex, deterministic process. It is guaranteed to converge to a single global optimum if there is a solution space. \\

Another advantage of LP is it can deal with thousands of variables, which makes it suitable for the study of a molecule's coordination composition at interfaces. Furthermore, LP problems are intrinsically easier to solve than many non-linear problems. \\

Various algorithms are available in solving LP problems, such as: Simplex algorithm, Interior point, and Path-following algorithms. Both Interior Point and Simplex are common and mature algorithms that work well in practice. Simplex is comparatively easier to understand and implement than Interior Point. Simplex method takes the advantage of the geometric concept that it visits the vertices of the feasible set (convex polyhedron), and check the optimal solution among each visited vertex. The converging approach is also different for these two methods. If there are $n$ decision variables, usually Simplex will converge in $O(n)$ operations with $O(n)$ pivots. Interior point traverses the edges between vertices on a polyhedral set. Generally speaking, Interior point method is faster for larger problems with sparse matrix. However, when experimenting with these two methods, the speed of them is not much different from each other for our study. For our study, Simplex method has proved to be efficient and effective, and it is used for all the experiments. \\

Last but not the least advantage of LP is its speed. For any LP problem, if it has an optimal solution, this solution is always a vertex. Simplex method is based on this insight, namely that it starts at a vertex, then pivot from vertex to vertex, until it reaches the optimum. Although it has been shown that Simplex method is not a polynomial algorithm, in practice it usually takes $2n-3n$ steps to solve a problem ($n$ is the number of decision variables). \\

The LP solver we use is called ``GNU linear programming tool kit"(GLPK). It has implemented both Simplex and Interior Point methods in ACNSI C. It is open-source and intended to solve large scale LP problems. \\
	
\section{Aims and Scope}
Given some target experimental spectra and a set of candidates spectra, then figuring out the right combination of candidates for the target spectra is the goal in this study. The approach is to build a LP model, and check if the optimal solutions returned by the solver match the target composition pre-generated. Spectral information of different spectroscopy techniques is applied to the LP model, then we analyze which spectral information helps to obtain the target composition with the highest accuracy. Furthermore, various types of candidate situations are considered, such as: candidates coming from one type of molecule; candidates coming from a mixture of molecules. At last, the experimental spectral information is brought into consideration.
