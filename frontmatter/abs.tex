Applying linear programming to vibrational spectra to extract the molecular structure at interfaces is a new approach. Research has been done to explore the possibility of using linear programming. However, this new approach has not been studied systematically. We show the use of linear programming using spectral information data first for a toy model, then for situations with real molecules. Appropriateness for the use of the data from IR, Raman, and SFG spectroscopy techniques for our use case is discussed.
